# Space-Shooter
A little space shooter in UNITY

Controls:

- Move your ship with keyboard's arrows or AWSD

- Fire with mouse left click

- Fire special rocket with mouse right click ( limited )


You have a shield which recharges quickly after not taking any damage for 10 seconds ( you can reduce it to 2 seconds ).

There is a shop between each waves where you can buy limited upgrades.

It's an unlimited waves game, the goal is just to get the highest score ( extra coins give extra points at the end ).
